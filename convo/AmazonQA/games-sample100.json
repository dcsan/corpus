There are some longivity issues but it's still a good setup that offers the most features for the money, great for a first timer.CH Products aren't as flashy and modern looking but tend to last a long time and have excellent sensitivity and accuracy.  The CH software is also very lightweight on resources and offers good programing and the ability to combine multiple devices into one virtual joystick for compatibility with more programs.  CH also has a helpful fan base and third party forums, search for CH Hangar in Google.",

The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards.

If you have PS+ you get free games every month to keep if you keep your PS+ subscription current. After a few months of free games it pays for like half the cost of the VITA. Make sure you get a memory card if you will be downloading games. Or buy a bundle with a card. Some VITAs don't come with a card, like the regular Wi-Fi version. I have an 8GB card with a few games on it and there's still room left for at least a couple more. Hope this information helped!",

I own a ps3 and I don't use the vita for it since it doesn't do many remote play for many games compared to the ps4 which has every game compatible to do remote play. Another thing to take into consideration is the use for the vita , is it to play ps3 games or actual vita games. I personally just use my vita on the days where I don't wanna get up and get the ps4.  Since it's a handheld system you will also have to buy a memory card only from sony so that's something to think about. I hope that helps",

Even with the presence of Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe, TLOU is much, much better acted and it is possibly the best written game in the history of gaming. I have played a lot of games, but TLOU is, in my opinion, the best I've ever played. That said, Beyond Two Souls is still very good. It has an unusual story and even though I wasn't tempted to replay it like I was with TLOU (which I've played repeatedly - I'm about two third of the way through on Grounded right now). It doesn't have the physical beauty of TLOU, but I really liked the pace of Beyond Two Souls. Compared to nearly any other game, it feels slow. Almost casual. But the two games do belong to a class of games that some gamers criticize, because they really don't want games to have stories. I personally like dungeon crawlers and games with tremendous stories. This is more like games like Metal Gears and The Walking Dead and a few others that have strong stories to go with whatever kind of gameplay there is. TLOU was, in my opinion, as close to perfect as any game we are likely to see. Beyond Two Souls is not perfect, but it is nonetheless very well worth playing, expecially at the current price. My only suggestion would be this: do you have a PS4? If so, hold off to see if and when they are going to convert it to PS4. Heavy Rain is being made into a PS4 game so they very well may do this one as well. Other games you'd expect to be converted have not, the most surprising being Bioshock Infinite (though there the problem is internal chaos with the developing company and who has the rights to alter it).\n\n\n\n    The two games are similar in that the story dominates everything.

Hopefully one of these two methods will solve your problem (you can even do both). They both start the same way so let's begin.1. Remove the seven screws on the back of the arcade stick (not the four holding the rubber feet on) to open up the controller.2. Unscrew and remove the square gate (white plastic piece directly beneath the joystick)- Here is where the two methods differ. I have tried both but the easier one (which worked well for me) I will write first.Method 1: Electrical TapeThis is an easier sort of quick fix that's guaranteed to reduce the wiggle room in your joystick.3. Move the four black pieces (exposed after taking the square gate off) away from the white cylinder piece in the middle. *Remember the orientation of these four pieces for when you put it back together*4. Wrap around the white cylinder with electrical tape. I believe any tape would do, electrical tape is just a precaution.5. Test the tightness of the stick by screwing the four black pieces back down and playing with the stick. Add more tape as needed.6. Reverse every step all the way back to one to put the stick back together.Method 2: Tightening the SpringThis one would be just as easy as putting tape on if it wasn't for removing the c shaped clamp. You'll see once you try (or maybe I just suck, lol). One of the videos at the bottom shows how to take the clamp off.3. On top of the white cylindrical piece there is a screw and a metal c shaped clamp. Remove the c shaped clamp.4. This cylinder should come apart, dislodging the joystick and exposing a spring. Stretch the spring (the longer the spring, the tighter the joystick).5. If you are comfortable taking off and putting on the metal c clamp, feel free to test out the joystick and adjust the spring to your liking. (This was very difficult for me on my V3 which is why I went with method #1 even though this method seems more professional.)6. Put the stick back together by reversing every step back to step one.Here are some videos to help if I was confusing or left out details.Removing the square gate on a V3:     youtube.com/watch?v=zNOE95P4lYY    start at 0:00 and stop at 1:30, the rest isn't important for what you're doingUsing Method 2 to tighten the spring: youtube.com/watch?v=4K2ONYAapOQ start at 2:26 and stop at 4:30, again the rest isn't importantContact me if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n    Hi Will, I know of two methods to tighten the joystick on the V3 without upgrading the joystick or replacing parts.

        "answers": [
          {
            "answerText": "That is a difficult question, since the form factor differs on the two.  Not quite comparing apples to apples.  I looked up the CM Storm QuickFire TK and I see they incorporated the DLT-PrtScn-Arrow Key section as 2nd Functions into the Numpad area.  This smaller form factor decreases the distance between your left and right hand and may be more comfortable for your shoulders, or that's atleast the idea.  I haven't owned a smaller form factor keyboard myself.Form factor wise it would be better to compare the K65 with the CM Storm QuickFire TK.  The QuickFire TK would win hands down, because of a lack of features on the K65- no wrist rest, back-lighting, etc.The K70 has a very nice volume controller on the keyboard and dedicated media keys, but if you don't use media keys that often or if you do, but don't mind using them as a 2nd Function, it doesn't matter that much not having them as dedicated keys.The K70 has a very nice wrist rest and this may sound stupid, but this wins high points for me with the K70, since when I use a desktop keyboard really alot, I get keyboard wrist inflammation, if that is even a term.  I bought a wrist gel (3M make for both my keyboard and mouse) months before I decided on which mechanical keyboard I was going to buy so that I wouldn't prefer one over the other just because of this add-on and so that I would have one if I decided to go with a keyboard without one.  I used that gel wrist rest with my mouse, and it worked for a decent amount of months to stop the small frequent friction of my wrist against the mousepad/wooden table, but then I started to get a lasting pain a little higher up in my wrist because of the declining position I had to hold my wrist in to use the mouse with the wrist rest.That said, I have no problems with the K70 wrist rest, and that just shows how well designed it is and how even if you buy a separate wrist rest, it will probably not be as comfortable as the one provided with the K70.Subjectively for me, I would go with the K70 instead of the CM Storm QuickFire TK, since I enjoy the dedicated media keys and volume controller and its wrist rest.  At the time I bought my K70, only the cherry mx red version was available.  I would advise you to go with the cherry mx brown version out now since it has a little bit of a tactile feedback.  Also, get yourself some rubber o-rings from amazon that reduces the key travel by supposedly 2mm and reduces bottoming out noise.  I use it myself, trust me, it works very well.You might want to wait if you want more back-light color options on your keyboard since the corsair K70 RGB is almost out (all though only with cherry mx red keys at the moment, I would advise cherry mx browns, like I said).  It gives you options to all the colors of the rainbow and more.  It cost $40 more than the regular K70 version, so it's up to you if it is worth the cost.If you have to go for a keyboard now, I would say get the corsair K70 cherry mx brown.  I also use the textured key-caps W, S and D, not the A since it is curved to the left and for the purposes I use it, I don't find it comfortable.
