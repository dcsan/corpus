en365_party_1,Rosa," I’m also well. I’m still studying at the medical college and I have two more years to go. I have a part-time job, but it doesn’t pay well for my studies. I’m just doing it to gain some medical experience.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_party.htm,Party,,1,
en365_party_1,Ksenia," So, do you work at the hospital?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_party.htm,Party,,1,

en365_party_1,Ksenia, You’re right. Not everyone gets a diploma with distinction these days. She must have worked really hard.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_party.htm,Party,,1,

en365_party_1,Rosa," Yes, of course. This is Ben. He has also got a distinction diploma. These are Lisa and George. They are from Brighton. Theya have a two-year old daughter Kimmy. I’m sincerely proud of them. Having a child and studying at the same time is not an easy thing.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_party.htm,Party,,1,
en365_party_1,Mary, You’re right. It’s rather uneasy. Let’s toast to your friends. They deserve it.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_party.htm,Party,,1,

en365_exams_1,Diana, Mine is on the 5th of June.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," That’s great! We can then go to the seaside, right?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," Yes, but there is one exam which I couldn’t pass, so I’ll have to retry at the end of this month.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," In which subject, I wonder?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," In Psychology. This year we had many teachers changing, so it was quite difficult to learn something valuable.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," It’s a pity! I was in the same situation two years ago. But my problem was German. We had several different teachers during the year, so it was hard to keep up with the pace. I’m sure you’ll be fine. We’ll just have to plan our holiday for July.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," Yes, sorry I can’t make it earlier. It all depends on the results of this exam.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," How did your Literature exam go? Was it easy to pass? As far as I know, Ms. Adams is rather strict.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," Indeed, she is. It wasn’t easy, but I simply love Literature, so I knew all the answers in advance. I passed it with merit, of course. However, Ms. Adams tried to ask some additional and uneasy questions.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine, Glad to hear it. How about History?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," It went well, I’d say even easy. Mr. Brian is a lovely person. Even if I answered only one question out of two given, he’d be satisfied.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," Yes, I know he is rather kind. Well, my last exam will be in the format of testing. I must say I don’t like tests, as they can be tricky at times.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana, What do you mean?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," I mean there were cases when I knew the right answer, but accidentally chose the wrong one. While at the oral exams you can say something, explain your views or quickly correct the wrong answer, during the tests there is no way to correct the mistakes. Computer then checks the number of your correct and incorrect answers and nothing can be changed.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," I see. Yes, tests should be done precisely, otherwise it’s hard to get good results.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine, Have you passed any tests this year?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," Not during the term exams, but during the academic year we had some.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine, Do you mean all your term exams were oral?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," Almost. There was only one written exam in Economics. It was like a test, but with the opportunity to express your own opinion.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," Ah, I see. We also had this exam. It wasn’t as difficult as it seemd to be. So, when are we going to head towards the seaside?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Diana," As we agreed, in July. Let’s just hope that our last and unfinished exams will be passed successfully.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_exams_1,Catherine," In that case, we can be free for the rest of the summer.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_exams.htm,Exams,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," Nadya, what’s your favourite school subject?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya, There are two of them: History and English. What about you?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," You’ll be amazed, but I like Maths most of all.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya,": Oh, I don’t like Maths. All these formulas and definitions don’t make sense for me. I always mix them up.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," Well, I can say the same about English. I can never distinguish Past Simple Tense from Present Perfect and I don’t understand how people can.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," You need more practice, I guess.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," I’ve tried. My parents even hired a tutor to help me, but it didn’t work.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya, How about History? Do you like it or not?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," I’m not very interested in this subject and I often mix up the dates, facts and periods.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya, What do you mean by mixing up the periods?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," I mean, the ancient times for me are the same as the medieval.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," I see. I also forget the dates sometimes and I find it hard to remember all historical facts, but I should say our History teacher is a very interesting narrator. I can listen to her stories for hours.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," I totally agree. It is rather interesting to listen to her. Besides, she is never mean to children.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," Yes, that’s true.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael, What do you think about Biology?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," I really like this subject. If I was going to enter some medical college, I would definitely put more effort into studying Biology.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael, And I think that our teacher of Biology is unreasonably strict. She never praises us for our efforts and assigns lots of homework.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," That’s true. She seems to be very strict. However, I think she is rather fair-minded. She just wants us to work harder and to develop interest in her subject.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," Perhaps, you are right.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," I can say the same about our Geography teacher. He is rather strict too, but I love being at his lessons. Geography is a very interesting subject. It makes me want to travel and explore the world.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," I also like this subject. However, if I had to choose my second favourite subject, I’d choose PE.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya, That’s because you are one of the best basketball players in our class.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael," Not only because of that. I think that PE lessons are good for health. If we did more physical exercise, we would always stay fit.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya," I agree, but we have these lessons only twice a week.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Michael, Another subject that I find to be useful is IT. Knowing computers and the way they operate is useful nowadays.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,
en365_school_subjects_1,Nadya, You’re right. Computer science develops rapidly.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_school_subjects.htm,School Subjects,,1,

en365_economics_1,Patricia, And my last question is about the stock markets. How are they linked to the economy of the country?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_economics.htm,Economics,,1,

en365_football_1,John, Why? Is Messi your favourite player?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_football.htm,Football,,1,
en365_football_1,Dave," Yes, he is one of my favourite players. That guy is a real professional. He won dozens of championships.

He also works as the captain of his native Argentinian team.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_football.htm,Football,,1,

en365_studies_1,Teacher," Of course, you may. What’s your question?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," I’d like to know more about British education, because we are moving to London next year.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Oh, how interesting! So, you’ll be studying at a new school next year, is that right?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," Yes, that’s true. My parents were invited to work for a year or two in Great Britain. I want to go with them and study in England. In fact, I’ve always wanted to learn more about English culture and traditions. Hopefully, I will have enough time for that.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," In my opinion, you will get easily accustomed to life in England. You are a quick-witted person.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," Thanks, Anna Vladimirovna!",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Just make sure you improve your grades in Maths this year, as many English schools specialize in Mathematics. I know you are rather good at Humanitarian subjects, especially at Foreign languages, so it won’t be a problem for you to study in England. Just work harder on Maths.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, I will. I know. It’s my weak point.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Answering your question, I should say that English education isn’t much different from our system. However, there are certain differences which I can explain.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," Yes, that’s what I want to know. Moreover, next year I will be at my 9th year of school and I don’t even know which subjects I’ll be studying.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," English education consists of several levels: early years, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. At your age you will be receiving secondary education, which is compulsory. Your typical course of studies will include Social studies, Science, Mathematics and Language Arts.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, Are there any exams at this stage?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Each semester you will be given certain ammount of tests in different subjects to check your general progress. At the end of the year there is a more serious end-of-course test. If you are planning to stay there for several years, you should know about GCSE.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, What is GCSE?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher, It’s an academic qualification in a specified subject. English children pass this exam closer to the end of secondary education.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, How difficult is GCSE?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," It is a rather serious exam, because it has strong influence on your further college or university education. The content of the exam might change every year, so you need to keep up with the program if you want to pass it successfully. The best result is an A grade. The person who gets 3 A Levels gains a university place. The format of the exam differs for various subjects.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, What if I want to pass GCSE in English?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Then, you will have to show excellent reading and writing skills. The History GCSE usually covers medieval and modern eras. Science GCSE includes studies about human genome, space physics, etc.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," Thanks so much, Anna Vladimirovna! That explains a lot to me.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," Not at all! I’m happy to help you with educational questions. So, do you think you might stay in England for further studies?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice," I’d love to. But it all depends on how well my studies go. Of course, I will do my best to keep up with others, but I think it’s not going to be easy for a newcomer.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Teacher," You’re right. It’s never easy to start something new, but I’m sure you’ll be just fine. Don’t worry about it!",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,
en365_studies_1,Alice, Thanks! I’ll try no to.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_studies.htm,Studies,,1,

en365_halloween_1,Patrick," I like celebrating Halloween with my family and friends, but I think that this holiday is a little spooky.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,

en365_halloween_1,Patrick," Yes, but do you know its origin and meaning?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda," Not, really. For me it’s just a funny holiday on the 31st of October, when we dress up in costumes and masks then go trick-or-treating. What else should I know?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," Well, it is one of the oldest holidays of pagan origin, which falls on the last day of the Celtic calendar. This holiday was thought to honor the dead. Can you imagine that?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, How scary! I thought the day was celebrated to welcome the saints.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," You’re almost right. All Hallows Eve comes right before the All Saints Day, which is on the 1st of November. This holiday was created by Christians, who wanted to convert pagans.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, I see. That’s good to know.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick, Another meaning of Halloween is to denote the end of summer. In Celtic culture this holiday was known as Samhain. It was celebrated annually on October 31st as a harvest festival with huge bonfires.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda," I wonder, what else did they do on this day?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," I don’t know for sure, but I’ve read that many things on this day were based on superstitions. For example, people believed that the dead came back from their underworld and roamed the streets at night.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, That scares me. I will now be more careful on Halloween night.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," Don’t worry. It’s just a superstition, which people made up themselves.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, What other superstitions did they have?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," They believed that not all spirits were kind. So, they left some gifts and treats outside to pacify the evil.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, Why did they want to please the evil spirits?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick, To ensure rich crops next year.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, I see now where trick-or-treating comes from.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick, Exactly. This is how the custom originated.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda," I don’t know everything about old Halloween traditions, but I definitely like the modern ones.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick," Which ones, for example?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda," I like decorating the house inside and outside with candles, pumpkins, black cats, skulls, scarecrows, various monsters, etc. I also like the sight of jack-o’-lantern in front of nearly every house in the neighbourhood.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick, I agree. Halloween decorations are quite nice. Which costume are you going to wear this year?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Amanda, I’ve decided to dress up into an imp. How about you?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,
en365_halloween_1,Patrick, I’ll be a pirate this Halloween. I have a special Jack Sparrow costume for this occasion.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_halloween.htm,Halloween,,1,

en365_teacher_and_student_1,Student, How long will it take?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_teacher_and_student.htm,Teacher And Student,,1,
en365_teacher_and_student_1,Teacher," Well, you need an hour every day at least for a week or two. I’ll tell you when to stop after I see the progress in Maths.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_teacher_and_student.htm,Teacher And Student,,1,

en365_teacher_and_student_1,Student," Well, at first we should calculate what’s in brackets, then powers and roots from left to right. Only after that we should concentrate on multiplications and divisions. And, finally, there are additions and subtractions.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_teacher_and_student.htm,Teacher And Student,,1,

en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter," Hi, Andy. Nothing new really. All is well in general. How are things with you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy," Fine, thanks. I’m planning to join our school football team. They are playing at the yard tomorrow. Are you with me?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter," No, never. Forget about it. I told you many times that one of my worst enemies is playing for this team. In fact, their team is rather weak. You must be crazy to want to play on their side.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, Not true. They have a great team. Wesley told me they are doing good progress on the field.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter," He can tell you anything, but I know that they have never won during the city championship.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy," Well, that’s because they are a comparatively new team. I’m sure they are working hard to play better.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter," Do, as you wish. I’m never joining them. Moreover, I even don’t want to see their unprofessional game. I better watch a good match on TV.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, Does that mean you are not going to come to my game?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter, Exactly.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, Fine. And that tells me that you are not my best friend anymore if you can’t simply come and support me. Next time you ask me about something I’ll remind you about that.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter, Why are you so upset? Isn’t Wesley your best friend since recent times?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy," Well, of course, he is a good friend of mine. We’ve met last autumn. As he was a newcomer at the class, he needed some friends and I offered him my help in finding some. As for you, we’ve been friends since kindergarten. How can you ignore the fact?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter," I don’t. I just want my best friend to support me in certain situations. For example, only a week ago I told you that Matt a halfback offended me. After that you want to join their team and to play for them. I won’t applaud to you if that’s what you are expecting.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, I don’t need your approval. I just want you to come and watch the match when I play. It doesn’t matter who else plays for this team. The only thing that should be important for you is that I play there.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter, I see. You are too self-centered to see my point.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, You too then. Don’t call me anymore and don’t ask me to help you with homework.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter, I won’t. And you don’t ask me to defend your younger brother when he gets into trouble.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy," Fine, I won’t. I’m sure my new friends will give me a helping hand when needed.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Peter, I don’t care. I don’t need a friend who doesn’t value our friendship.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,
en365_friends_arguing_1,Andy, Good-bye then.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_friends_arguing.htm,Friends Arguing,,1,

en365_the_tv_1,Sam, My favourite TV show starts now.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty, You mean that program about science and technologies?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," Yes, exactly. They tell lots of interesting things about new technologies.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty, Do they tell you that watching too much TV is unhealthy?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," Come on, Betty. Don’t be a bore.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," Well, I wouldn’t if you hadn’t occupied the only TVset in the house for twenty-hours a day.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam, This show lasts only for half an hour. Then I’ll let you watch what you want.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," Ok, turn it on.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam, Look! They are speaking about the history of TV.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," That’s exatly what we need to know right now. In my opinion, TV was invented long before we were born.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," Of course. Along with the radio it was one of the earliest broadcasting tools. The first mechanical televisions were sold in 1928. Later on, there were the first mass-produced units.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," Well, the TV was black-and-white then. When did the color TV appear?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," As far as I know, they came into wide use in late 1960s.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," I still remember our first TV. It seems to be so old-fashioned now, when there are thousands of digital, LCD, plasma TVs.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," You’re right. We’ve also had a video recorder, which was gradually replaced by DVD player.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty, Why do people invent so many unnecessary devices?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," Why unnecessary? I think they all make people’s life easier. It’s called the technological progress. Each year, there are newer devices launched on the market. Imagine how you would live without a vacuum-cleaner or a microwave. These automatic machines are nearly in every house today.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," On the one hand, you are right. We really need such devices like washing machine, microwave, dishwasher, vacuum cleaner in the house. However, when it comes to TV, I think that we could easily live without it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," You’re saying that because you have a computer. If you didn’t have it, you would watch TV more often.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty, That’s true. I watch most of the films on my laptop.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," In my opinion, computer is the same TV only with additional information and facilities. It also has a screen and you can watch whatever you like on it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty," Yes, but in addition I listen to music, type my homework, chat with my friends, edit photos, read the news and find all the necessary information via Internet.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Sam," I still think that TVset is a great invention. In fact, many modern TVs allow you to connect laptop or any other devices to it so that you can work on a larger screen.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_the_tv_1,Betty, I didn’t know about that.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_the_tv.htm,The TV,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul," Are you a fan of television, Ellie?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,

en365_television_1,Paul," Well, I enjoy all music channels. They keep me entertained during the day. Other than that, I watch the Discovery channel to know more about the newest informative and entertaining facilities. When I’m in the mood for cartoons, I turn on the Disney channel. What about you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," I also like music channels and Discovery. Apart from that, we have a channel about current tennis championships. As you know I’m a big fan of this sport, so I never miss the global events.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, Any other interesting channels?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," There is one channel where I can watch the episodes of my favourite TV show «Friends» and another channel which specializes in foreign languages. For example, when I have free time I learn some Spanish by just watching TV.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, That sounds great. Are there any other informative foreign language channels?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," A lot. My sister, for example, watches Turkish soaps with subtitles to learn to understand some Turkish. I know there is a channel with Italian movies and music. You can easily learn some Italian by watching it. French and German languages are also available.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, I’m highly interested in Norwegian. Are there any Norwegian channels?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," We don’t have one, but you should ask your satellite provider. The easiest way to find out is simply to scroll through all channels.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, I’ll check when I’m home. That would be great to watch some TV shows in Norwegian.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," If you don’t find what you need, I advise you to try the Internet possibilities. You should simply type in online lessons of Norwegian at the search engine that you use.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul," You’re right. Internet is almighty, isn’t it? It includes even the TV. My laptop easily transforms into the source of television.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," I totally agree. Mine too. Although our TV has a huge screen, so I prefer to watch most interesting shows on it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, Do your parents watch TV?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie," My dad always watches football matches and business channels, which inform about the currency and stock rates. My mum on the contrary watches only cooking shows and some soap operas. How about your folks?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, My dad prefers to watch the Euronews channel to stay informed about current situation in the world. He also watches some shows where politicians participate in debates. My mum likes TV-shops’ channels. She sometimes orders the items that are being advertised there.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie, That’s interesting. I’d like to order something from TV-shops as well. They often demonstrate useful household items.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,

en365_television_1,Ellie, Wow! That’s fantastic!,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, I have an idea! Why don’t we watch something together at my place? I have a bucket of delicious ice-cream and if I’m not mistaken your favourite TV-show «Friends» starts in half an hour.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Ellie, Do you also watch it?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,
en365_television_1,Paul, Occasionally I do. Today I’ll keep you a company. Besides you can tell me what happened in previous episodes. I missed a whole week.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_television.htm,Television,,1,

en365_at_the_doctor_s_1,Patient 2," Yes, sure. I have a bad earache along with frequent fever and headaches. Another thing, which bothers me is a toothache. I think, that it’s a wisdom tooth. Can it be also causing earache?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_doctor.htm,At the Doctor’s,,1,
en365_at_the_doctor_s_1,Doctor," I see. Toothache can also be the reason, but I will have to look at your ear closely. Also I need to check your throat. Can you come a bit closer Ms. Stain?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_doctor.htm,At the Doctor’s,,1,

I’ll write all the necessary medicine in the prescription. There is a pharmacy downstairs and you can find everything there. Moreover, I recommend you to see the dentist, because I can only stop the pain and fever, but I can do nothing about the main cause of your condition.

en365_car_service_1,Mechanic," We’ll try, but it all depends on the source of damage. What’s the problem that you want to have fixed?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_car_service.htm,Car Service,,1,
en365_car_service_1,Mr. Brown," I’ve had several cases when the accelerator let me down. I’d like to have it checked on the first place. Further on, it’s the horn, something is wrong with it as well.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_car_service.htm,Car Service,,1,

en365_car_service_1,Mr. Brown," Thanks, but I’m having a business meeting in 20 minutes. One of my colleagues should pick me up in a minute or so. I’ll get back by midday. Is that all right?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_car_service.htm,Car Service,,1,

en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, Quite a lot. Ms. Seymour has told us to read a number of stories by O. Henry and to write short essays on certain topics.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, It’s a shame you have to spend so much time doing your homework. It’s snowy outside. We could go sledding and have lots of fun.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," Yes, I know. That upsets me. The New Year is approaching and I still haven’t prepared any gifts or postcards for my family and friends. It’s been three days without rest. I definitely need to get in the holiday spirit.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, I have an idea. Why don’t we go holiday shopping. Most stores hold New Year sales these days. So there is a chance to find a fancy dress or shoes for low price. Besides you can find the presents for your mum and dad.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, Sounds good. Where shall we go?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, We can go to the «Ocean» mall. As we’re done with shopping there is an opportunity either to go to the cinema or to go skating.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, Great. Let’s do that. Although I’d choose bowling instead of skating or watching a movie.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita," I’m Ok with that. Just promise that we’ll watch the new «Christmas stories» one day, no matter where: at the cinema or at home by DVD. I spoke to Shania. She says the movie is wonderful.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, My dad knows where to buy new films on DVDs. I’ll tell him to find it.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, How and where are you going to spend the New Year night anyway?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," We usually stay at home. Before the night all together we decorate the fir-tree, put some presents under it and prepare tasty dishes. My mum is responsible for the holiday dishes. However, this year we decided to spend the holiday night at my uncle and aunt’s place. They invited us a week ago and my parents agreed.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, Will you still cook something traditional?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," Of course. My mum is going to make a sweet pudding with raisins and her favourite smoked salmon with spicy sauce. My dad will buy a bottle of champagne and a bottle of white wine. My uncle promised that we’ll watch the midnight fireworks together. All in all, it’s going to be a joyous celebration.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, Sound wonderful. I wish we could also spend the New Year night at someone’s place. It gets boring to stay each year at home.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, Aren’t you going to visit aunt Molly in Auckland?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita," Not this year. My dad has got some work to do on the New Year day, which he can’t skip. So, we’e staying here for the rest of the holiday.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, It’s a shame. You can join us at midnight to watch the firesorks at the central square.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita," Do you think, that would be Ok with your folks?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," Definitely, yes. They’d love to see you there. More than that, you can come for our festive dinner. I’m sure my uncle wouldn’t mind.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita," I’m not sure about the dinner, but as for the fireworks, I’d love to join you. My parents normally don’t keep this tradition. What else do you do during the New Year holidays.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, We visit the rest of our relatives and family friends simply to with them happy New Year and prosperity. Sometimes we exchange presents or postcards and have a small tea party with pastry.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, Sounds delicious. My mum also has some friedns over for tea after the main event. You are welcome to visit us anytime.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," Thanks, I’ll tell my mum about it. Hopefully, we can be at your place on the 2nd or 3rd of January.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita," While our parents chat, we can go sledding at last. There is a nice hill next to our house and I have one spare sledge which you can use.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane," It’s hard to believe but I’ve never done that before. I went skiing, skating, but never sledding. I’m sure it’s a lot of fun!",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Rita, It is indeed. It’s even better when there is lots of snow.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,
en365_new_year_holidays_1,Jane, The weather forecasters promised that this winter will be snowy.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_new_year_holidays.htm,New Year Holidays,,1,

en365_moscow_1,Elena," After all, you are right. Moscow is beautiful indeed. I’m proud to be living here.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_moscow.htm,Moscow,,1,
en365_my_house_1,Valeria," Hi, Zhanna. Haven’t seen you for ages! How are you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,
en365_my_house_1,Zhanna," Hi, Valeria. I’m fine, thank you. We’ve recently moved to a new place, so I’m not often seen in this area.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,

en365_my_house_1,Valeria," Oh, sounds lovely! I think a detached house is much better than a flat.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,
en365_my_house_1,Zhanna," It is. We have more space now for different activities. For example, we can play ping-pong or basketball in the backyard.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,

en365_my_house_1,Zhanna," Well, my favourite place in the house is the living-room. It’s a multifunctional room for us. We watch TV, play computer games, rest at the sofa, read books, have family parties and everyday dinners there. Even our kitten likes the living-room.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,
en365_my_house_1,Valeria, How about your bedroom? Is it spacious?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,
en365_my_house_1,Zhanna," It’s smaller that the living-room, but still I can have friends over. There is a bed, a wardrobe, a desk with a chair, a TV and a bookshelf. There is a thick carpet on the floor, so we can sit on it and play various board games, such as chess, checkers, bingo, dominoes, etc.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_house.htm,My House,,1,

en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha, I’m very well. I have six lessons today and then I’m free.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy, What are you planning to do?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," Well, I have some homework to do and then I want to ride my bike. Are you with me?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy," Sure. Why not? By the way, we have a new teacher of English. Her name is Mrs. Sanders. Is she teaching your class too?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha, Nope. Our teacher is Mrs. Ritter. We like her a lot. Isn’t English your favourite school subject?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy, It is. I like foreign languages. Next year French will be added to the list.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," As for me, I don’t like foreign languages that much. What’s so special about them? My favourite subject is Physical Education.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy," Good choice. Sport is one of the most important things of our life. I also enjoy Physical Education lessons. In fact, both languages and sport have something in common.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha, What do you mean?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy," They need constant training. If you stop practicing, you start forgetting certain words, rules and therefore lose certain skills.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha, You’re right. But I think that these two subjects are different in certain ways.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy, In which ways?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," Well, first of all, learning languages we train our brain. While doing sports we train our body.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy," I agree only partially, because doing any physical exercises we train not only our body, but also the brain.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," Perhaps, you’re right. There is also the second point.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy, I’m listening attentively.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," When you learn how to ride a bike you never forget it even if you don’t practice for a long time. When you learn a foreign language, you can forget most of it if you don’t pracitice it for several years. That’s the main difference.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy," I know. Speaking is especially difficult. You can remember the letters, how to write ot read, but speaking will be difficult if you don’t practice with anyone.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Martha," Exactly that’s my point. When you know how to swim or play table tennis, you don’t forget it. Of course, you can lose the proficiency if you don’t practice, but the main skills will stay.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_favourite_school_subject_1,Wendy, I undestand now why you like Physical Education more than other subjects.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_favourite_subject.htm,My Favourite School Subject,,1,
en365_my_hobby_1,Stephan," Nadya, do you have any plans for the weekend?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_hobby.htm,My Hobby,,1,

en365_my_hobby_1,Stephan," If I’m not mistaken, my sister also watches it. Her favourite character is Ross.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_hobby.htm,My Hobby,,1,
en365_my_hobby_1,Nadya," Oh, he is really charming. But my favourite character is Phoebe. She is a vegetarian and she loves animals.

en365_my_hobby_1,Nadya, I am really amazed. I’ve always thought you were a fan of alternative rock.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_hobby.htm,My Hobby,,1,
en365_my_hobby_1,Stephan," Well, yes, I was in the past. I still listen to some rock bands, but not very often.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_hobby.htm,My Hobby,,1,
en365_my_hobby_1,Nadya, Which fantastic stories do you read?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_my_hobby.htm,My Hobby,,1,

en365_between_teacher_and_student_1,Student," Although all the given verbs are different, they still have something in common. There are several groups which have the same ending or the same way of formation. That’s why the easiest path is to break the list of irregular verbs into several groups.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_teacher_and_student.htm,Between Teacher And Student,,1,
en365_between_teacher_and_student_1,Teacher, Can you show any examples?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_teacher_and_student.htm,Between Teacher And Student,,1,
en365_between_teacher_and_student_1,Student," Yes, sure. For example: think-thought-though, bring-brought-brought. Here is another example of similar word formation: sing-sang-sung, sink-sank-sunk.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_teacher_and_student.htm,Between Teacher And Student,,1,

en365_between_friends_1,Mike, Can you fix it?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,
en365_between_friends_1,John, I already did. Try it now.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,

en365_between_friends_1,Mike, Last week I bought a new camera to take it to the beach with me and now there is something wrong with it.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,
en365_between_friends_1,John, What do you mean?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,

en365_between_friends_1,John, Let me see. Did you keep the warranty check?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,
en365_between_friends_1,Mike," Yes, I did. It says I can either return the item within two weeks if there are any problems, or I can take it to the authorized repair center.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,
en365_between_friends_1,John, In my opinion you should return it and choose another one. It’s not a good sign if a new camera doesn’t work only after a week you’ve bought it.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,
en365_between_friends_1,Mike," Well, I guess that’s what I’ll do.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_between_friends.htm,Between Friends,,1,

en365_space_1,Rachel," Phil, look. This TV program is about your favourite topic.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil, You mean about space exploration?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, Exactly. They’ve just told that one orbiter has reached the Jupiter.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil, When did it happen?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, I don’t know. They’ve reported that a special shuttle was launched several years ago with the orbiter on it. It was meant to be a five-year flight and it has reached the target now.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil, That’s amazing! If things develop so quickly we’ll soon be able to travel to other planets ourselves.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, Is that your dream to fly in space shuttle?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," Well, I have two dreams. First of all I’d like to conduct space explorations when I graduate from school. There is a good university in the UK that offers space exploration program. That’s where I’d like to study. Hopefully, I will pass the exams. My second dream is to participate in one of space flights.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, Where do you want to fly?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," Perhaps, to the Moon. It’s the only natural satellite of our planet. Another option is Mars. It’s the nearest planet to explore. Many scientists are interested in studying its surface.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, I see. I know that the Apollo 17 mission was set in 1972. It was the last time when people set foot on the Moon. After that only unmanned spacecrafts were sent there.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," Well, you never know. Space engineering is now in full progress, so hopefully there will be other flights. More than that, I’ve heard that by 2050 people will be able to purchase travel certificates to the Moon.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel," We’ll see. By the way, who is your favourite cosmonaut? Mine is Yuri Gagarin.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," I also admire this man. He was the first human to travel into outer space. It happened on the 12th of April, 1961. Since then this day is considered to be a famous holiday in Russia — Cosmonautics Day.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, I wonder how difficult was this flight?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," I don’t know exactly, but he spent almost 2 hours on board of Vostok 1 spacecraft. That must have been hard.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel," In fact, he’s been awarded lots of medals and titles after this flight.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," Well, he deserved it indeed. In my opinion, he is an outstanding man. Another space explorer that I admire is Valentina Tereshkova.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, Who is she?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," She is a retired Soviet cosmonaut, who was the first woman in space. She was chosen out of hundreds of other applicants to pilot Vostok 6.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, When was her flight?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," A bit later than Yuri Gagarin’s flight. She was sent into space on the 16th of June, 1963.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel, I see. How about Neil Armstrong? I’ve heard a lot about this space explorer. What’s he famous for?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil, He was the first astronaut to walk on the Moon. Before becoming an astronaut he was a simple officer at the U. S. Navy.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Rachel," That’s good to know. Well, I hope that you will also reach some heights in space exploration. And, I wish you good luck with that!",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,
en365_space_1,Phil," Thanks a lot, Rachel! I will try to do my best.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_space.htm,Space,,1,

en365_cuisine_1,Chef," Yes, you’re right, but we have so many customers with different tastes that we prefer having a variety of dishes on the menu. At the same time we have our own way of cooking and serving.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, What do you mean by that?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," I mean, if it’s a pizza, we add some of our special seasoning. If it’s a sushi, our cooks from Japan decorate the plate with nice carvings. Every dish in our restaurant has a signature.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer," Sounds interesting. Do you do any other cuisines? For example, what if the guest wants to taste barbeque?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," Of course, we can prepare it. That’s why we are called a gastro-pub, not just a restaurant. Every day we receive a large amount of fresh products, which we use to cook our specialties.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, What’s your favourite dish?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," It’s a baked salmon with crunchy rice. My colleagues are real professionals, but I never trust this dish to anyone.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, Can you say it’s your signature dish?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," Yes, I can. As for the national Japanese and Chinese cuisine my sous-chef perfectly works in that field.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, What about the drinks and dessert? Who is responsible for that?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," Well, the drinks are mainly served by our bartender, while the desserts are prepared by our cook from Paris. He prepares superb pastry and various desserts.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, Will you show us anything in action tonight?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef, With pleasure. I’m going to make an Italian dish — Spaghetti Bolognese.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, What will you need for this dish?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," Spaghetti — half a kilo, Prmesan cheese, one onion, some red wine, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 tins of tomato and bacon. It’s a classic Italian dish which is not difficult to prepare. It also occupies little time, which I’m sure the housewives will like.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, What do you do first?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef," At first I chop the onion and garlic on a board and add some herbs. Then I add some rosemary leaves to the bacon. After that I place everything in a large saucepan and cook it on a medium-high heat adding a tablespoon of olive oil. At the end I add some tomatoes, red wine, salt and pepper.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, How about the spaghetti?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Chef, It’s the easiest part. I simply cook it until it is al dente. At the end I add some Parmesan and the dish is ready.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,
en365_cuisine_1,Interviewer, Can I taste it?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_cuisine.htm,Cuisine,,1,

en365_family_conflict_1,James," I’m sorry, honey, I have no idea. I just think you should get more concerned about some life issues.

en365_computers_1,Rita, Viruses! It’s impossible. I have reliable anti-virus software. Should be updates.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_computers.htm,Computers,,1,
en365_computers_1,Vlad," Let me see. Yes, indeed, you need to update the programme. Other than that, make sure you don’t open unknown documents. It is a frequent way of cyber espionage. I have once received a document within an e-mail saying that it’s from my close friend. I also had anti-virus, but when I opened this document, it caused sensible damage to my personal documents.

en365_computers_1,Vlad," That’s true. Every house today has at least one or two computers. Some people use laptops, some use iPads and smartphones.

en365_computers_1,Rita, I see. What complicated inventions are these computers! I wonder who invented them.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_computers.htm,Computers,,1,
en365_computers_1,Vlad," Well, all I know is that they were invented long before we were even born. The first Z3 computer was invented in 1941 by German engineer Conrad Zuse. I don’t know the exact reason, but perhaps it was invented for some calculations or for storing the information. This computer was soon destroyed by bombing during the war.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_computers.htm,Computers,,1,

en365_computers_1,Vlad," You’re right. The idea of personal computers didn’t exist until 1960s. Moreover, home computers were developed for household use in early 1980s.

en365_summer_1,Liza," I sleep long hours when I get there. Perhaps, it’s because of the fresh air and quiet atmosphere. When I’m there, together with some friends I go to the nearest lake to swim.

en365_business_trip_1,Liam, They provided us with a professional translator. Her name was Sarah and she accompanied us everywhere during these five days.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,
en365_business_trip_1,Greta, I see. That explains a lot. Where did you go after the arrival?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,
en365_business_trip_1,Liam, They drove us to one posh hotel where we could rest after the flight. After that we had to participate at one important meeting with international colleagues. I met many interesting people there. The meeting went well. Then we were free to exlore the city.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,

en365_business_trip_1,Liam, I have an old school friend who lives there. I wrote him a message saying that I’ll be in Paris for several days and he agreed to meet at some point. We went to the street cafe to chat.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,

en365_business_trip_1,Greta, Have you seen anyone playing the hand-organ in the streets? I know that Parisian street music is romantic.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,
en365_business_trip_1,Liam, I have. I’ve seen this old gentleman a couple of times playing some music in front of our hotel.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_business_trip.htm,Business Trip,,1,

en365_smoking_1,Garreth," I’m well, thanks. And you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," I’m fine, thank you. At the moment I’m working on one project and I want to ask you some questions.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth, What’s it about?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel, About smoking. You know I don’t smoke and I don’t like the smell of smoke.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth," Yes, that’s true. You are a fan of healthy lifestyle. As for me I do smoke, but I’m trying to quit. If I can help you somehow with the project, you can ask me your questions.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," Well, first of all I need to write about the reasons for smoking. Then I need to make a list of negative effects of this bad habit and to work out the way for the younger generation to avoid it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth," I see. That must be a useful project. If someone like you told me about the harm of smoking when I was a teen, perhaps I wouldn’t even have started it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," That’s why I wan’t to make a resultative project. So, can you name at least three reasons why you smoke?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth," At first, it was just the way to keep a company to my smoking friends. I think I sometimes smoke not because I want a cigarette, but simply for being social.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," In that case, I’ll have to find some strong arguments against your reason. What’s the next one?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth," The second reason is of course the dependence on nicotine. Once you start smoking, you become dependant on it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel, Any other reasons?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth," Yes, one more. I think I tend to smoke more when I get nervous. It seems to soothe me. However, I don’t know whether it has any logical proof.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," How do you feel after smoking: healthy, full of energy or depressed and exhausted.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth, More likely depressed and exhausted. It seems to take a lot of energy and health.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," That’s the answer to all the reasons you gave. It’s not worth it really. I know lots of people, including me, who keep a company to smoking people without actual smoking.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth, Really?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," Yes, however I don’t like it, because I’m sure that inhaling the smoke of cigarettes is also unhealthy. When I tell my friends that it makes me feel uncomfortable, they try not to smoke when I’m arround.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Garreth, How about two other reasons? How would you confront them?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_smoking.htm,Smoking,,1,
en365_smoking_1,Samuel," Well, dependence of any type is damaging and dangerous. Once you understand that you depend on a cigarette, you should start thinking about how to quit this bad habit.

en365_holidays_1,Esther," It was great as usual. I like such long holidays. However, when you stay at home for too long, you start missing the school, the lessons, your classmates. And, I did go to the beach for a week.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_holidays.htm,Holidays,,1,

en365_holidays_1,Esther," We went to Hawaii this summer. I should say the beach there was fantastic. White sand and beautiful sea — that’s all you need for a good beach vacation.

en365_holidays_1,Esther, I know what you mean. I saw some of his works on the Internet and I also thought they were a bit strange. Any other places that you visited during the holiday?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_holidays.htm,Holidays,,1,
en365_holidays_1,Alex," To be honest, not many. Most of the time I played with my cousins at their backyard. Oh, wait, I remembered. We also went to see this outstanding building in Barcelona, which was built by one famous architect. I forgot the name of it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_holidays.htm,Holidays,,1,

en365_concert_1,Magda," If we don’t want to be late, we should hurry up.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena, When does it start?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda," At 5 pm and it lasts for almost two hours. Perhaps, there will be a short interval between the performances.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena, Sounds good. I’ll be ready in half an hour and then we can go.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,(after the concert,(after the concert),,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda," So, how did you like the concert?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," I loved it. I didn’t expect to see so many young and talented musicians. Despite their age, they were rather confident on stage.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda," You’re right. I liked that too. In fact, these groups are formed by the students of the Medical university, which is even more surprising.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," Indeed, I wouldn’t expect to see the future doctors sing and play musical instruments that well.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda, It’s a shame my mum couldn’t go.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," Please, thank her from me for such an exciting evening.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda," I will, don’t worry. Next time I’ll tell her to get more tickets.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," Look! There is the guy, who played accordion so well. Do you think we could approach him?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda, You mean to take an autograph?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," No, just to thank him for great music.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Magda," Yes, why not? That’s a good idea! As for me, I’ll ask him for an autograph. In case, he becomes a well-known musician, I’ll have a legendary signature.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,
en365_concert_1,Selena," I should say, you are foresighted, my dear friend.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_concert.htm,Concert,,1,

en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana," Hi, Julia. How are you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," Hi, Diana. I’m fine, thank you. And you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana," I’m also well, thanks. How is your foreign languages’ learning going?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia, Great. I really like the classes. Our teachers tell us lots of interesting things every day.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, What languages do you study?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia, I study English and French. English is for my career development and French is for pleasure.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, I remember that you had certain difficulties with English grammar and French pronunciation. How is your progress?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," Well, my teacher of English explains grammar rather well. Each time I don’t understand something, I ask her to explain it again. She finds many different ways to explain each topic. So, now I don’t have any problems with grammar.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, How about French?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," The teacher of French is also rather experienced. I understand everything he explains. However, the problem with my pronunciation still exists. He says I will do much better if I visit France and chat with native speakers.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, That’s a good idea. Why don’t you try it?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," I will. In spring my teacher is planning to arrange an educational tour to Paris. He is looking for students who want to join. The more students we attract, the funnier and more interesting the tour will be.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, Are you going to attend the lessons of French there?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," Yes, we are. We are going to live in our penfriends’ houses. The good thing is that we get to have lots of speakig practice while we stay in French families. Apart from that, we will go to the French school everyday. I hope such training will help me to improve my poor pronunciation.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, Sounds interesting. I’d like to join you. I need to ask my parents’ permission though.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia, Do you know any French?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana," Just a little bit. I used to attend supplementary classes of French last year. Then, I gave up as I didn’t have much free time. My sports training takes lots of time and effort, as you know.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," I see. Well, it’s a good chance for you to learn some basics.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana," Yes, that’s why I find this educational tour rather interesting. What else are you going to do during your stay in France?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," We are going to see the sights of Paris, but the main goal is to improve our language skills. It includes reading, speaking, listening, writing and most importantly comprehension skills.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, What do you mean by comprehension skills?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," My teacher says that these skills are the most important ones. They involve everything at once. As soon as you start understanding what you read or hear, you can try to respond according to the situation. It’s the first step to learning foreign languages.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana," I see what you mean, but I’ve never spoken to anyone in French or English. I should be extra attentive if I want to understand their speech.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia," That’s the main clue. As soon as you understand separate words and put them together into phrases, other language skills start to develop without any difficulties.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Diana, Thanks for telling me this. I have always wanted to learn at least one or two foreign languages.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,
en365_learning_foreign_languages_1,Julia, You can join me at my foreign languages’ classes anytime.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_languages.htm,Learning Foreign Languages,,1,

en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny," Good point. No, my full name is Jonathan.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Dan," By the way, Johnny, Angy is from Madrid, in Spain and it’s her first time in New York. Can we show her around? I know that you’re good at telling about local sights.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny," Of course, we can. It’s a great idea. Besides, I used to be a guide in the past. At the moment, I’ve changed my speciality a bit and I work as a real estate agent. It’s one of the most popular professions in New York nowadays. Anyway, Angy, if you’d like we can be your guides, while you’re here. By the way what do you do?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Angy," That would be lovely. Thanks so much guys. New York is really big. One might get easily lost here. I’m a student, by the way. I study to become a teacher of English. And one of my main goals is to practice my spoken English.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny," Oh, I see. That’s why your English is so good. I’m glad we’ve met. We can talk as much as you want, right Dan? Besides, we have lots of other friends who would also gladly go out with us.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Dan," Yes, absolutely. None of our friends speaks Spanish or other languages, so all you will hear is spoken English.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Angy," That’s great! I’m also glad to have you aroud, guys.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Dan," Oh, look, Johnny! Isn’t that Lisa over there?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny," Yes, I think it’s her. And she is with her new boyfriend. What was his name?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Dan," Peter. Yes, you’re right it’s them. Let’s call them over here. They’ll be also happy to meet Angy.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny, Let’s do that.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,
en365_meeting_new_people_1,Dan, Hi guys!,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_meeting.htm,Meeting New People,,1,

en365_meeting_new_people_1,Johnny," Guys, Angy is from Spain and she would like to see more of New York. Besides, she needs some practice in conversational English.

en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," What are you reading so absorbedly, Glenn?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn, It’s a booklet about environmental protection and the use of recycling. You should read it too. There is lots of useful information.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," I see. That’s an interesting issue. I’m used to recycling plastic bottles, but what else can we recycle?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," Nearly everything. All items can be recycled for further creation of new products. Basically, the old and unwanted materials are put into new use instead of just throwing away.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," I didn’t know about that. For me, recycling simply meant the reduction in the size of landfills.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," Well, it’s one of the most notable benefits that come from recycling. However nature and wildlife preservation is also important.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla, What do you mean by that?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," For example, paper recycling alone saves millions of trees. As we save trees from chopping, we save lots of wild animals, whose habitat is the forest or jungle.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," Now, I understand. In that sense I fully support recycling. I don’t like that many animals become extinct. Last month I even participated in a campaign against animal testing.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," Unfortunately, most people don’t care about nature problems. Environmental protection is of no importance for them.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla, We could prepare a project on this topic and present it to the locals.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn, Do you think we’ll have supporters?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla, Of course. I’m sure that many people are interested in clean environment and healthy surrounding.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn, We could cover some other topics connected with environmental protection as well.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," Which, for example?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," Apart from this booklet, I found an article in the magazine about various types of pollution, their harm and ways of avoidance.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," Sounds like a good topic. I could give a speech about recycling, while you could prepare a speech about air, water and other types of pollution.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," I don’t mind. I can speak for hours about this topic. When it comes to pollution, the main source of harm is technological progress and factory tests. Modern factories throw into the environment so much waste that many sea animals die, people get sick, wildlife suffers.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," What other types of environmental pollution do you know, except the air and water pollution?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn, I know there exist noise and light pollution. There are also visual and thermal types of pollution.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla, Never heard of them. I wonder how these things happen?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," Imagine constant noise coming from airplanes, motor vehicles, construction process, etc. They all lead to high levels of human and animal stress. Bright street lamps, extra lights around the home negatively affect human health.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla, What about visual and thermal pollution?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Glenn," We speak about visual pollution, when numerous skyscrapers block the natural view. They make the cities look dull without enough sunlight in the streets. Excessive billboards are also considered to cause visual pollution. Thermal pollution can be caused by nearby manufacturers, when they pump warm and dirty water into natural water bodies.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,
en365_environmental_protection_1,Sibylla," That’s a rather complex topic. I would appreciate if you spoke about it. There are many issues which I’ve never heard or met before. I’m sure that many people in the town are just like me — illiterate in terms of environmental problems. So, they’d interested to learn something new.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_environmental_protection.htm,Environmental Protection,,1,

en365_heathy_lifestyle_1,George, I did mainly weight training. It helped me to build up the muscles.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_heathy_lifestyle.htm,Heathy Lifestyle,,1,
en365_heathy_lifestyle_1,Nika, Why did you give up then?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_heathy_lifestyle.htm,Heathy Lifestyle,,1,

en365_the_internet_1,Ross," Rather often, I’d say. I use it every day, because I need to check my e-mail, to read the news, to chat with friends. Why are you asking anyway?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy, I’m trying to make a survey with answers about the Internet and its frequency of use. I’ve already asked seven people and now I need to compare the facts. Do you mind being one of my respondents?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,

en365_the_internet_1,Andy, What type of information do you usually search for?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross, I search for anything that’s concerned my studies. I need lots of new information for doing my homework.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy, Do you simply copy what you find?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross," No, our teachers won’t accept any foolish copying. I try to adapt the information to my tasks. I also try to write everything in my own words.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy, I see. How about music? Do you use the Internet to listen to music?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross," Yes, of course. I always listen to online radio. Moreover, I sometimes surf the Internet for song lyrics.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,

en365_the_internet_1,Andy, Thank you. This information is very useful for me.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross, Do you have any other questions?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy," Yes, few more questions. Can you tell me what your favourite website is?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross," I like many websites. Some are connected with music, others with films and books. However, my favourite website is Wikipedia, because it gives answers to most of the questions. It also helps me greatly with my studies.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy," Do you use social networks or chats? If yes, then what for?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross," Of course. I have lots of friends in social networks. I like chatting with them, exchanging music, postcards and simply interesting or funny information. I don’t use various chat. In my opinion, social networks are more handy for that. Sometimes I use skype, when I want to talk to friends or relatives, who currently live in other countries.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy, Two more questions. Do you use online dictionaries?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,

en365_the_internet_1,Andy, Could you live a day without the Internet?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Ross, My answer is no. I think that nowadays nearly everyone is addicted to this computer tool. All people have computers or laptops in their houses and they definitely use the Internet every day. I am not an exception.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,
en365_the_internet_1,Andy, I see. Thanks for helping me. Now I have enough information for my survey.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_internet.htm,The Internet,,1,

en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," In my opinion, if you want to see all of London, you need to stay here at least for a month.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," I agree. We are always short of time. For example, two days ago we went to see the London Eye and our guide said we have only time for one ride and nothing more. When I wanted to take more pictures and to learn more about the history of the wheel, he said we have no time for that.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack, What do you want to know? I can tell you. I’ve bought a thick book of London sights before coming here.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," Just some more details, because the guide said only a few words about it.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," Well, it is considered to be one of the biggest Ferris wheels in the world. Its structure is 135 metres. All in all it has 32 capsules, each holding up to 25 people. It was opened to public in March of 2000.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," Sounds interesting. And, who was the architect of this gigantic construction?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," There were several architects who designed the London Eye, among them Frank Anatole and Nic Bailey.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, All right. Can you tell me a bit more about Westminster Abbey? I really liked the gothic style of this outstanding building.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack, Let’s see. Here it is. My book says it is one of the most notable religious constructions in Great Britain. It’s been used as the traditional place of coronation and burial site of English monarchs for many centuries.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, When was it built?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," In the 10th century, but the present church was built by Henry III in 1245.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, I’ve heard that many famous Englishmen were buried in Westminster Abbey.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," Yes, it’s true. Among them, Geoffrey Chaucer, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and many others.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, Does your book say anything about the Tower of London?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," Sure. It’s a historical castle, which has played a prominent role in English history. It has served as a royal palace, prison and place of execution, fortress, arsenal, jewel house and even a zoo for exotic animals. This is where Anne Boleyn was beheaded.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," How interesting! And, do you kow where we shall go today?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," The guide said we were going to see Madame Tussaud’s museum and the Tate Gallery. However, I think it’s almost impossible to see such an immense art collection in just one day.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, I agree. We’ll be running around as usually. Let’s learn some information about these sights in advance.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," Good idea! So, the museum of Madame Tussaud was first opened in London in 1835. The founder, Marie Tussaud, was originally from Strasbourg. She was taught the art of wax modelling when she was a teenager. Approximately at the age of 17 she created her first wax figure of Voltaire. Today, her museum contains hundreds of wax figures of prominent people: sportsmen, politicians, singers, actors and actresses, etc. Moreover, the museum of Madame Tussaud has now branches in many other cities across the world.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, How about the Tate Gallery?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," It was founded in 1897 and contains the largest collection of British art. Besides, it has a large collection of international contemporary art. Until 1932 it was known as the National Gallery of British Art. Then the gallery was renamed after Henry Tate who was a sugar magnate and one of the people who laid the foundations for the collection. Today people call it Tate Britain.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike, I see. Are there any other attractions that we are going to visit till the end of the week?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack, Our guide said we will definitely see the official London residence of modern Englsih monarchs — Buckingham Palace.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," Oh, I’ve always wanted to see Changing of the Guard ceremony at the Buckingham Palace. Hopefully, we’ll be there on time.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," My book says that this ceremony usually takes place at 11.30 am and continues till 12 pm. At some days, the ceremony is cancelled, for example, due to very wet weather.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Mike," Let’s hope the weather will stay fine till the end of this week. And, I should say you’ve bought a very handy book.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_london_attractions_1,Jack," Thanks! I always buy guidebooks before going to other countries. I think, they are useful when you are in a new place.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_london.htm,London Attractions,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy," Hi, Adam. How are you?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,

en365_countryside_1,Lucy," I’m also well, thank you. Haven’t seen you for ages at the countryside. Where have you been?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam," You are right, I haven’t been here for quite a while. I was mostly in the city with my parents. Apart from that, we went to Greece for a one-week holiday. So that’s why I couldn’t come to visit my grandparents.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy," I see. Well, that’s good you’re here now. We can have a great time.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,

en365_countryside_1,Lucy, Me and my brothers are going to the lake to swim and sunbathe tomorrow. If you want you can join us.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam, I’m not a fan of sunbathing you know. I could fish there while you swim.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy, It’s up to you. Do you have a fishing rod?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,

en365_countryside_1,Lucy, Is there anything else that you want to do in the countryside?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam," Yes, I’d like to make a bonfire in the evening. While the weather is good, we can sit around it and tell each other different stories.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy, Which stories? Funny or scary?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam," It doesn’t matter. I simply like spending time in the company of good friends. I haven’t seen everyone since last winter. I should say, I missed them.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy," I see. Well, Veronika and David aren’t here at the moment. They moved to the city a couple of months ago.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam, Is Renat here?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,

en365_countryside_1,Adam, Sounds great. Let’s invite him too.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy, What else do you want to do while you are here?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam, I’d like to pick one day specially for active games. We could play hide-and-seek or volleyball. Whatever you guys wish.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Lucy, We’ll do that. We can also play ping-pong at our yard. My dad bought a special table for tennis and I have the rackets with balls.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,
en365_countryside_1,Adam, That’s a great idea. I’m one of the best table tennis players at my school.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_countryside.htm,Countryside,,1,

en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, Good afternoon. How can I help you?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," Good afternoon, doctor. I’d like to discuss some nutrition problems which I’ve been facing recently.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, What’s the problem?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," I come from another country, to be precise from the USA. The food I find in local supermarkets is a bit different from what I’m used to eat, so it gives me some health problems.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, I see. What did you use to eat back home?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," To be honest I ate lots of ready-to-cook-food, as I had a busy schedule.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, That’s not good. How did you feel?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," I was used to it. I often ate hamburgers, French fries, canned soup, cold sandwiches, pizza, doughnuts, etc. There were days, of course, when I cooked something healthier, such as baked potatoes, fish with rice, fresh salads.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, I see. What do you buy here?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," Again there is lots of ready-to-cook food at supermarkets. I buy burgers, pizza, cakes with various fillings, canned fruit, roast chicken.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist," That’s not very healthy. You should buy fresh meat instead of the cooked one, fresh fruit, more herbs, freshly-baked bread and certain dairy products.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, Isn’t it called a balanced diet?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist," Exactly. To keep your body and mind healthy you should include into your daily ration bread and milk products, lots of fresh vegetables, home-raised meat and eggs. What do you usually have for breakfast?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, A cup of coffee with a sandwich.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, I advise you to eat at least a small portion of oatmeal for breakfast as it’s healthy for you. It gives energy and positive vibes for the whole day. Drink a glass of orange juice and have one or two home-raised eggs — boil or fry them. What do you eat for lunch?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, I don’t have much free time during the afternoon so I simply buy a canned soup and again a sandwich or a hamburger at the roadside cafe.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, You should definitely change this habit of eating junk food. For lunch you should have a portion of fresh salad and a chicken or fish cutlet with rice. Drink a cup of black or green tea and have a piece of sweet cake or a bar of chocolate,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, Isn’t sweet bad for our health?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist," Not when taken in small portions. Chocolate, on the contrary, gives additional energy and positive emotions.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," I see. Thanks for the advice, doctor. I have a sweet tooth, so such diet definitely suits me.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, Let’s have a look at you supper. What do you usually eat in the evening?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, I can skip this meal. I take a can of non-alcoholic bear and a pack of crisps. That would make my dinner.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist," Oh, that’s the worst part of your daily meal. You should change this habit immediately.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew, What shall I have for dinner then?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist, Boiled vegetables with roast beef would be ideal for you. For a drink have a small glass of red wine. It will help you to digest the food and it will lower your cholesterol.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," Sounds good, but sometimes I come so tired after work that I don’t want to cook anything. What shall I do in this situation?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Nutritionist," Well, what can I say, Matthew? In that case you need a girlfriend who enjoys cooking.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,
en365_diet_1,Matthew," Thanks for the advice, doctor. I will try to follow all your recommendations, especially the last one (smiles).",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_diet.htm,Diet,,1,

en365_global_warming_1,Nadya," Daniel, what day is it today?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel, The 3rd of November.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya," It’s unnaturally warm outside for this season, don’t you think?",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel, It’s all the result of global warming.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, What do you mean by global warming?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel, I mean climate is changing worldwide. Due to rapid technological progress many things have changed. The world glaciers are gradually melting and the weather is getting warm even in winter.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya," I see. So, it’s the rise in temperature of Earth’s climatic system. That’s not good at all.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," Moreover, the weather in some parts of the world is becoming unnatural. For example, it has never snowed in Africa, today it occassionally does. Speaking about our country, each year I feel that it’s getting a bit warmer and less snowy.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, How terrible! I like the snow. Winter is my favourite season. How are we going to celebrate New Year in the future?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," We’ll see. Perhaps, without any snow.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, Why is this global warming happening anyway?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," It is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It acts as a blanket, which traps the heat and warms the planet. It’s also called the greenhouse effect. As you can guess, it is happening because of irresponsible human actions. As we burn fossil fuels or burn vast spaces of forest, carbon overloads our atmosphere.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya," I could never understand why people use fossil fuels, such as oil or coal, and why they burn whole forests.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," Well, you see, they need fuel for energy and forests are cut down or burn to create new space for pastures or plantations. While we try to grab more land or to get more energy, we harm our planet. Everything is interconnected.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, That’s sad indeed. I believe that global warming is not the only problem on our planet.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," You’re right. There are pleanty of environmental problems nowadays, such as pollution, deforestation, overpopulation, natural resource depletion, acid rains, etc.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, And it’s all the result of human careless behavior. Can’t there be anything done about it?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," Of course, it can. However, most people are too lazy to include some simple rules in their life.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, What can we do to prevent global warming?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," First of all, we should start recycling paper, plastic and glass. Choosing reusable products instead of disposables would be also good. Secondly, we should drive less cars and start using bicycles. Thirdly, it is highly recommended to use less heat, hot water and air conditioning. And, as my father says, we should plant more trees instead of cutting them down.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, These are good tips. Are there any other rules?,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Daniel," We can also change the light bulbs in our houses. Regular bulbs should be replaced by fluorescent light bulbs. They are a bit more expensive, but they last much longer. We can start buying other energy-efficient products. There are many home appliances today that come in a range of energy-efficient models. And, finally, we can encourage others to follow these rules.",,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,
en365_global_warming_1,Nadya, It would certainly be beneficial for our planet if everyone followed these rules.,,,https://www.en365.ru/dialog_global_warming.htm,Global Warming,,1,

en365_where_do_you_study_1,Ruby," It’s mostly a theoretical discipline which describes the relationships between the individual and the world.

en365_great_britain_1,Dima," They live in Southampton — a city on the south coast of England. It’s the largest city in Hampshire county. I liked this place very much.

en365_great_britain_1,Dima," First of all, we visited the Trafalgar Square and saw the Nelson’s Column on it. Secondly, we were at the Piccadilly Circus. It’s now one of my favourite parts of London.
